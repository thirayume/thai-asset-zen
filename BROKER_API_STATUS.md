# Broker API Integration Status

## ⚠️ Current Status: PLACEHOLDER IMPLEMENTATION

### Problem
The `brokerAPI.ts` file contains **fake/placeholder endpoints** for the SET Trade API. This means:
- ❌ Real trading is NOT functional
- ❌ Order placement will fail
- ❌ Authentication uses incorrect flow
- ❌ API endpoints are guessed/example URLs

### Why Can't We Fix This?
The official SET Trade REST API documentation is not publicly available. We need:
1. Real API base URL (not `https://api.settrade.com/api/v2`)
2. Correct authentication method (likely HMAC signing, not OAuth)
3. Request/response formats
4. Available endpoints and parameters
5. Error codes and handling

### What Works?
✅ MT5 integration (real-time price streaming)  
✅ AI trading signals generation  
✅ Position monitoring  
✅ Paper trading simulation  

### Required Actions
To enable real Settrade trading:

#### Option 1: Use Official Python SDK
```python
# Settrade provides a Python SDK
pip install settrade-api
```
- Create a bridge edge function that calls Python SDK
- Use Deno's subprocess or HTTP bridge

#### Option 2: Get API Documentation
1. Contact Settrade support
2. Request REST API documentation
3. Implement based on official specs
4. Update `brokerAPI.ts` with real endpoints

#### Option 3: Use Alternative Broker
Consider brokers with public REST APIs:
- Interactive Brokers (has REST API)
- Alpaca (US stocks)
- IG Markets (has REST API)

### Security Note
Even with placeholder implementation, broker credentials are:
- ✅ Encrypted at rest in database
- ✅ Never exposed to client
- ✅ Protected by RLS policies
- ✅ Validated before storage

When real API is implemented, the security infrastructure is ready.

### Current Mitigation
The application uses:
- **MT5 for real trading** (fully functional)
- **Paper trading mode** for testing strategies
- **Settrade integration** marked as "future enhancement"

Users should use MT5 integration for live trading until Settrade REST API documentation is available.
